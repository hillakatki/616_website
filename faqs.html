			<div class="main-section">MANAGEMENT</div>

			<div class="sub-section">Board</div>

			<div class="question-first">Who are the board members and what are their responsibilities?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">The Maxx Management board representative is Leon Manoucheri. There are four shareholder board members: Carlos Hoyos, Sam Bernstein, Christine Miller, and Jesse Dorris. Each board member gets a vote and decisions are made officially by majority rule, though our board has consistently functioned by consensus. The board oversees the physical plant, budget, and various building committees; it also fields resident complaints, and enacts and oversees capital improvement projects.The management company is contracted to assist the board in these tasks. The board members volunteer their time for this responsibility and invite on other shareholders to become active in the building by joining or leading committees.</div>  

			<div class="question">What are the time commitments/ responsibilities of being a board member?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">Our building currently has a 5-person board of directors, 4 of those filled by shareholder occupants who are in good financial standing, elected for a one-year term at an annual shareholder meetings each spring. Board members meet every month from 7pm to approximately 9:30pm, usually on the first Tuesday of the month. In addition, board members optionally attend committee meetings, which are sporadic throughout the year. Board members also meet with prospective shareholders and sublessees to approve and/or meet, as needed. A considerable amount of internet research, coordinating with management, responding to building issues by e-mail, and other forms of administrative work are required between meetings in order to be an active board member. </div>

			<div class="question">How do I join the board?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">All shareholders will receive notification of the time and place of the meeting and elections a few weeks in advance. They made submit nominations upon receipt of the letter and up until the elections take place by e-mailing the board at <a class="text" href="mailto:board@616east18.com">board@616east18.com</a>. Alternatively, they may announce their candidacy at the meeting.</div>

			<div class="question">How do I attend a board meeting, or communicate with the  board?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">Board members meet on a monthly basis on or around the first Monday of every month. To attend a meeting, or to reach out the board, please e-mail us at <a class="text" href="mailto:board@616east18.com">board@616east18.com</a>.</div>

			<div class="question">What reports/documents from the board are available to the shareholders?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">Meeting minutes of each meeting are kept by our management company, and available upon request. The yearly budget and expenses report is also sent to each shareholder. The board will send updates related to the building through newsletters and the building mailing list.</div>

			<div class="question">What type of projects have been completed, planned, or are underway?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">We deal with large and small projects alike. Some examples of recent projects include:
				<ul>
					<li>Local Law 11 - facade and terrace maintenance. Brick facade repointing, fixing leaks.</li>
					<li>Replacement of boiler, heating survey, and insulation of coldest apartments</li>
					<li>Simpler application forms and review process.</li>
					<li>Lobby beautification and redesign</li>
					<li>Garden and landscape</li>
					<li>Social "meet and greet" your neighbor</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="main-section">FACILITIES</div>

			<div class="sub-section">Cable, Internet, &amp; Cell Service</div>

			<div class="question-first">What are my options for antenna/cable/satellite/fiber-optic in this building for TV and internet?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">The building is served by Verizon FIOS and Optimum Online. Call them to set up an appointment to install/activate your service. Dish Network is not allowed because shareholders are prohibited from installing satellite dishes on their terraces or the roof.

			<p>Occasionally salespeople manage to gain access to the building in order to go door-to-door, asking residents to switch providers. Solicitation is not allowed in the building and shareholders should feel free to ask them to leave the premises.</p></div>

			<div class="question">Which cell phone service providers have the best coverage in the neighborhood and building?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">Residents have found that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile provides the best coverage in the neighborhood and building. As of this writing (April 2015), Verizon cell phone service ranges from spotty to non-existent within the building.</div> 
			
			<div class="sub-section">Garden &amp; Shared Space</div>

			<div class="question-first">Can I reserve the garden/back-yard space for a private gathering?</div>
			<div class="body-copy">All residents are free to use the shared garden space. We do ask that residents do not socialize in the outdoor public areas during quiet hours (11 PM to 8 AM).</div>

			<div class="sub-section">Green Building</div>

			<div class="question-first">What has the co-op board done to make our building more &ldquo;Green?&rdquo;</div>
			<div class="body-copy">We have replaced most light fixtures (all floors except lobby) with ones with higher energy efficiency. We have also done insulation as part of the facade work, and have a newer boiler that runs more efficiently and with better type of oil. There is composting in the garden.  If you have other ideas, please contact the board at <a class="text" href="mailto:board@616east18.com">board@616east18.com</a>.</div>
